        <p>The universe of the <i>Game of Life</i> is an infinite, two-dimensional <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality" title="Orthogonality">orthogonal</a> grid of square
          <i>cells</i>, each of which is in one of two possible
          states, <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>, (or <i>populated</i> and <i>unpopulated</i>, respectively). Every cell
          interacts with its eight <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood"
              title="Moore neighborhood">neighbours</a></i>,
          which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the
          following transitions occur:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
